<b>SASS linter with Ruby is a command-line application </b> built entirely with Ruby, like a developer sometimes we have some rules to follow in order to apply good practices in our code, writing good code is always good, it helps other programmers to maintain them the application, this app checks if you had written your code not using good practices and left you to know which the line and column that need to be changed in order to have a clean code, for example <b> (Comment white space inside after, Comment white space inside before, Unexpected missing end of source newline, Expected empty line before the comment, Expected indentation of zero spaces, Expected indentation of 2 spaces) </b>.

## Getting Started

This project was built using Ruby, it is a command-line application and for running on your local environment you should follow these guidelines.

The **_SASS Linter_** does basic syntax checking, as well as applying a set of rules to the code and throws back an error if bad syntax is found.
The throwback error is being printed out indicating the line and column of the specific syntax issue.


### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.5
- Git
- have **Ruby** installed on your computer


### Setup

```
Using SSH 

# git clone  git@github.com:rubenpazch/capstone-project-linter-parses-files.git

Using HTTPS

# git clone  https://github.com/rubenpazch/capstone-project-linter-parses-files.git

```

+ Open terminal on your workspace with

```
cd /home/workspace/capstone-project-linter-parses-files
```








## Install

To run the test cases with RSpec we have to follow this steps:

installing RSpec

    gem install rspec

Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with, for this project we had used the version 3.9 

    rspec --version

finally run for watch the results

    rspec
