## Instructions

The **_SASS Linter_** does basic syntax checking, as well as applying a set of rules to the code and throws back an error if bad syntax is found.
The throwback error is being printed out indicating the line and column of the specific syntax issue.

To test out **SASS Linter** you need to:
* have **Ruby** installed on your computer
* [download](https://github.com/rubenpazch/capstone-project-linter-parses-files/tree/check_file) or clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
  git@github.com:rubenpazch/capstone-project-linter-parses-files.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS:
  ```
  https://github.com/rubenpazch/capstone-project-linter-parses-files.git
  ```

* Navigate to root directory of the repo and run on windows:
```
$ ruby ./bin/main path_to_file.scss (path_to_file being the file you want to check for linters)
```

* Navigate to root directory of the repo and run on ubuntu:
```
$ main path_to_file.scss (path_to_file being the file you want to check for linters)
```

## Testing with RSpec 

To run the test cases with RSpec we have to follow this steps:

installing RSpec

    gem install rspec

Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with, for this project we had used the version 3.9 

    rspec --version

finally run for watch the results

    rspec
